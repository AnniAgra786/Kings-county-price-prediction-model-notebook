This project is a Machine Learning group project aimed at building a model that predicts the price of listed houses in King County based on customer requirements. The goal is to provide accurate price estimations to assist customers and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Objective 

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of houses based on various features and customer requirements. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights to the real estate market.

## Tools and Libraries Used
### Python: 
We utilized Python programming language for data preprocessing, exploration, and building the predictive model.
### Pandas: 
Pandas library was employed for data manipulation, preprocessing, and exploration tasks.
### Matplotlib: 
Matplotlib was used for creating meaningful visualizations to gain insights from the data.
### Scikit-learn (Sklearn): 
Sklearn library was utilized for testing various regression algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
### Random Forest: 
Among the tested regression algorithms, Random Forest exhibited the highest accuracy of 86% and was selected for the final model.
### Streamlit: 
Streamlit library was employed to create a user-friendly web application for easy access and utilization of the predictive model.
### Tableau: 
Tableau was used for additional data visualization purposes, such as creating scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.

## Project Description
### Data Collection: 
We collected the necessary data for house sales in King County.
#### Data Preprocessing: 
The data underwent preprocessing steps using Python and Pandas, which involved cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
We performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between variables. 
Matplotlib and Tableau were employed to create informative visualizations.
### Feature Selection:
We selected relevant features from the dataset that had a significant impact on the house prices.
### Model Development: 
Using Scikit-learn, we tested various regression algorithms and evaluated their performance. Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy of 83%, making it the chosen algorithm for our predictive model.
Web Application: We created a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input their requirements and obtain estimated house prices based on the model.
### Deployment and Visualization: 
The predictive model and visualizations were deployed and made accessible for stakeholders to utilize and make informed decisions in the real estate market.
